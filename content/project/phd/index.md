### Biodiversity informatics and macroecological patterns of biodiversity. Uruguay as a model region

Biodiversity is declining at unprecedented rates in a rapidly changing world in which most species remain to be discovered. Thus, it is essential that countries generate mechanisms to quantitatively measure biodiversity and monitor its changes. Uruguay, in particular, covers a peculiar area where multiple bioregions of South America converge geographically, potentially driving unique biodiversity hotspots that result from the biogeographic connection of multiple bioregions. However, whether such hotspots exist in this country remains an open question, given the exceptionally limited knowledge about larger-scale biodiversity patterns. Although efforts have been made to document the distribution of biodiversity in Uruguay, comprehensive studies across the tree of life are limited and have received less attention. The aim of this study was to use Uruguay as a model region to quantify the patterns and processes of biodiversity across the Tree of Life. A key finding was to reveal that a strong sampling bias has historically affected the reconstruction of diversity patterns across all taxonomic groups in Uruguay. Therefore, it is not possible to draw definite conclusions as to whether the patterns of biodiversity we observe are real or fabricated by tactical sampling practices. This study highlights the critical knowledge shortfall situation in which Uruguay stands and, at the same time, suggests a first approach and a path to transit to start tackling this issue. Every finding in our study is a critical step towards the ambition to start a scientific quantification of biodiversity
in this country, to provide a resource for organisations and scientists, and to raise awareness at the government level
