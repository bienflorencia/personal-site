I aim to study species' geographic range distributions and their changes in time. My model taxa are carnivore mammals from the Neotropics (Latin America). I plan to model species distributions and the variations in time by integrating different types of data (i.e. presence-absence surveys and presence-only records) using integrative distribution models.
