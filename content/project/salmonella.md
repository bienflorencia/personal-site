Salmonellosis is one of the main foodborne diseases. The strains responsible for these infections belong to different serotypes of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica that differ in their epidemic and pathogenic potential.
The vast majority of cases of human salmonellosis are caused by a few widely prevalent serovars predominating Enteritidis and Typhimurium. The molecular determinants involved in this epidemic capacity remain to be elucidated.
