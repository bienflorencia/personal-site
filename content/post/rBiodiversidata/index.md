As part of my PhD project I have written some scripts for the Biodiversidata Project.
This are useful scripts for biodiversity data cleaning, processing and quality controlling.  

1. **Retrieving Conservation Status and Population Trend (IUCN).**
2. **Checking Species Names.**
3. **Retrieving Taxonomic Information for a Species.**
4. **Get Scientific Name Authorship for a Species.**    


You can find the scripts, explanations and examples in my Github repository.
