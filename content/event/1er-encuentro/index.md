This was the first meeting of the Biodiversidata members and consisted in four sessions, i) presentation of Biodiversidata, ii) progress so far, iii) agreements and commitments, and iv) plan of future goals. Participants from diverse biodiversity areas of expertise agreed this was a fundamental instance to understand the relevance of the initiative, discuss about the urgency of data openness in science in Uruguay, the aims of the new association and prioritise the future agenda of the organisation. The possibility of a face to face meeting enabled me to get to know the different experts and discuss the particular aspects of each biodiversity field. As agreed in the conference, from now onwards I plan to present a series of web meetings with specific topics and aims, to continue deepening in agreements and organisation aspects.
