## RDA 20th Plenary meeting and 10th Anniversary Plenary meeting

The [20th Plenary of the Research Data Alliance (RDA)](https://rd-alliance.org/plenaries/rda-20th-plenary-meeting-gothenburg-hybrid) and the 10th anniversary of RDA took place from 21-23 March 2023.

### Summary of the sessionÂ 

The session ['Towards implementable recommendations: taking advantage of the SHARC open science survey'](https://www.rd-alliance.org/plenaries/rda-20th-plenary-meeting-gothenburg-hybrid/towards-implementable-recommendations-taking-0) was an interactive discussion focused on a first draft of recognition guidance and recommendations towards various stakeholders proposed by the SHARC IG. Discussion and feedback from the audience helped identify some gaps, provided useful examples of ongoing initiatives/policies in the academic rewarding system, and some ideas on how to reach out actively the various actors needed.

### Key outcomes

  - Audience confirmed that rewarding schemes for OS activities, esp. data sharing, is needed.
  - Rewarding pathways are not well known and guidance would help.
  - Need to create recommendations as a global picture including all stakeholders, not separately.

### Presenters
Hanna Shmagun, KISTI, Korea del Sur; Florencia Grattarola, Biodiversidata, Uruguay; Christopher Erdmann, M.J. Fox Foundation, USA; Anne Cambon-Thomsen, Mogens Thomsen, Laurence Mabile, University of Toulouse III, Francia.

The [RDA Plenaries](https://rd-alliance.org/plenaries)' are exciting and productive events that bring together a unique community of data scientists, librarians, computer scientists, and domain scientists. Plenary meetings are special working events that really help move the community forward in creating tangible deliverables that improve data sharing across disciplines, technologies, and countries.

The [RDA-SHARC](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/sharing-rewards-and-credit-sharc-ig) interest group is an interdisciplinary group set up to unpack and improve crediting and rewarding mechanisms in the data/resource sharing process. The main goals are to foster the implementation of rewarding paths and encourage the adoption of data sharing activities-related criteria in the research evaluation process at the institutional, national and European/international levels.
