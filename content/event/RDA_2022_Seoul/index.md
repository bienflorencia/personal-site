The **RDA-SHARC** interest group is an interdisciplinary group set up to unpack and improve crediting and rewarding mechanisms in the data/resource sharing process. The main goals are to foster the implementation of rewarding paths and encourage the adoption of data sharing activities-related criteria in the research evaluation process at the institutional, national and European/international levels.

### Meeting objectives: 

We will run an informative and interactive session, aimed at discussing the necessity of rewarding Open Science activities. The discussion will be based on  the results of a survey conducted by some members of the RDA-SHARC IG. The objectives will be:

- To discuss preliminary results of the survey addressing awareness of Open Science activities and existing & expected reward systems in research assessment, in particular for sharing activities, in different contexts.
- To fuel the discussion conducted as part of the EC’s Coalition on reforming research assessment.
- To help feed future SHARC recommendations.

### Meeting agenda: 

- Introduction to the RDA-SHARC group
- Introduction to the survey
- Survey’s preliminary results presentation
- Collective discussion (possibly questions-mediated discussion or poll) and harvesting of relevant initiatives or tools  from audience

The session will be virtual and chaired by LM & ACT. Presentations and management of the session (online chat / verbal Q&A / collaborative  meeting notes / meeting minutes) will be shared by several members of the RDA-SHARC survey’s group.
