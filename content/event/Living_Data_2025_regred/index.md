## Session: 'Beyond 2030: Building the Data Foundations for Biodiversity Action to support the KMGBF'

Effective conservation biology relies on robust assessments of threats to species. While global evaluations are conducted through initiatives like the IUCN Red List, many countries and regions also produce their own threat assessments, often compiled into national or regional red lists. RegRed is a project dedicated to developing a comprehensive, accessible database of these localised assessments and associated sources that document threatened or extinct species at the national level. Our first phase, “RegRed metadata”, involved a systematic search and compilation of relevant sources worldwide (https:||github.com|petrkeil|RegRed_metadata). This effort yielded 2,093 sources from 172 countries, encompassing threat data across 487 broad taxonomic groups. The second phase, “RegRed data”, focuses on digitising the data, starting with the tetrapods group. We aim to extract species-level threat information from diverse conservation literature using a semi-automated workflow, including large language models (LLMs). The ultimate goal of RegRed is to create a standardised, per-species database of national and regional threat assessments to support research, policy, and conservation action. We invite collaboration to scale this initiative, promote decentralisation, and ensure broad participation in advancing global conservation knowledge.
