# Biography

I am a Uruguayan biologist, with a PhD in Life Sciences from the University of Lincoln (United Kingdom) and a Bachelor and Master in Science from the Universidad de la República (Uruguay). 

During my academic development I have been interested in several areas, from conservation genetics and macroecology, to environmental education, citizen science and biodiversity informatics. 

The focus of my current research is to quantify the distribution patterns of biodiversity. My aim is to develop an unprecedented field of knowledge for Uruguay by promoting a large, multidisciplinary collaborative initiative to collect all biodiversity data of Uruguay.
