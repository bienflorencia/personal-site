# Biography

I am a Uruguayan biologist, with a PhD in Life Sciences from the University of Lincoln (United Kingdom) and a Bachelor and Master in Science from the Universidad de la República (Uruguay).

My interests are around several areas, from conservation genetics, macroecology and biodiversity informatics, to environmental education and participatory monitoring. I am the founder of [Biodiversidata](https://biodiversidata.org/), a member of the [JULANA NGO](https://julana.org) and a NatGeo 2021 Explorer.

Currently, I am a postdoc researcher at [Petr Keil](https://petrkeil.github.io/website/)'s lab.
