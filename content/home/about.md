# Biography

I am a Uruguayan biologist (PhD), doing research in macroecology and biodiversity informatics focused on the study of spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity. I am a postdoc researcher at the Czech University of Life Sciences in [Petr Keil](https://petrkeil.github.io/website/)'s lab.

I am also the founder of [Biodiversidata](https://biodiversidata.org/), a member of the [JULANA NGO](https://julana.org) and the admin for [NaturalistaUY](https://www.naturalista.uy) as a NatGeoExplorer.
